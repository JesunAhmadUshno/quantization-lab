# PUBLICITY: quantization-lab (P11)

Publicity log under the documentation and publishing standard,
Section 7. Every finished level produces its written fan-out set,
each piece graded on the 1,000-point publicity rubric (accuracy 300,
research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150), ship line
900. Drafts are prepared by the loop. Actual social posting follows
the standing platform rules and gates. The loop itself never posts
to social.

Project state: v1.0, Learn, Build, and compressed Deep done
2026-11-05, 55 tests passing plus the scaffold smoke test. Level
grades on record: Learn 8,700 of 10,000, Build 7,600 of 10,000,
Deep 7,450 of 10,000.

## v1.0 fan-out set (2026-11-05)

Written fan-out set prepared in this cycle, in fanout/. Every
piece states plainly that the model is a small MLP trained in
this repo on synthetic data, not a real pretrained model, that
sizes are QLAB container bytes (QLAB is not GGUF), and that the
pruning rows are a NumPy equivalent track, not a TensorFlow
result. Every number is sourced from the repo files (README.md,
DOSSIER.md, the three level READMEs, and the three results
files). Tutorial commands were verified by running them; the
full suite (55 tests plus the scaffold smoke test) passes and
all results files stayed unchanged across the runners apart
from the Build and Deep timing fields, which were restored.

Overall fan-out grade: 9,468 of 10,000 (the mean of the six
piece grades below, scaled to 10,000: 5,681 of 6,000).

Jev claim_check on the blog main results claim (extracted byte
exact from fanout/blog-post.md by script, and verified verbatim
against the Deep README main result): model jev-1.13.0, 1,877
input tokens, question id supported, noul 0.77, route REVIEW
(claim_check bands: clear at 0.85 or above, block at 0.10 or
below, review between). Not blocked, so the claim ships in its
gated form. Spec and results are in the goal hidden_files
(jev-p11-fanout-claim-spec-2026-11-05.json and
jev-p11-fanout-claim-results-2026-11-05.json).

| GitHub release v0.1 | Learn release | Live: https://github.com/JesunAhmadUshno/quantization-lab/releases/tag/v0.1 |
| GitHub release v0.5 | Build release | Live: https://github.com/JesunAhmadUshno/quantization-lab/releases/tag/v0.5 |
| GitHub release v1.0 | Learn, Build, compressed Deep release | Live: https://github.com/JesunAhmadUshno/quantization-lab/releases/tag/v1.0 |
| Repo (blog) | Blog post draft | fanout/blog-post.md, repo draft. Not posted to any blog platform. |
| Repo (tutorial) | Tutorial draft | fanout/tutorial.md, repo draft. Every command verified by running it in this cycle. |
| Repo (website) | Website page copy draft | fanout/website-page.md, copy only. No website was changed by this file. |
| LinkedIn | Post draft | fanout/linkedin-post.md, DRAFT NOT POSTED. Held: posting follows the standing platform rules; the link is carried as the first-comment line in the draft, per the LinkedIn rule. |
| Paper | Candidate brief | fanout/paper-candidate.md. Submission is Jesun's tap; nothing submitted, no venue contacted. |
| Repo (release notes) | Release notes | fanout/release-notes.md, covering v0.1, v0.5, and v1.0 with measured results and release links verified with gh release list. |
| X | Social post | Held: no post made. The loop never posts to social; drafts only under the standing platform rules. |
| Facebook | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Facebook rule applies (no link in body or comments, keyword call to action by DM) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Instagram | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Instagram rule applies (link in bio) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Threads | Social post | Held: awaiting Jesun's tap. Every Threads post needs his one-tap pre-approval, hash-locked on exact text and media. |
| Video | 3D playbook video | Held: flagship video production runs through the January engine queue. No video produced in this cycle. |
| Book | Book chapter | Held: chapter drafted from finished projects under the journey publishing plan; no chapter file is claimed in this cycle. |

Per-piece publicity grades, on the 1,000-point rubric (accuracy
300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150),
ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fanout/blog-post.md | 295 | 185 | 195 | 145 | 140 | 960 |
| fanout/tutorial.md | 295 | 180 | 195 | 148 | 135 | 953 |
| fanout/website-page.md | 295 | 175 | 190 | 145 | 140 | 945 |
| fanout/linkedin-post.md | 290 | 170 | 190 | 145 | 145 | 940 |
| fanout/paper-candidate.md | 295 | 190 | 195 | 140 | 120 | 940 |
| fanout/release-notes.md | 298 | 180 | 185 | 145 | 135 | 943 |
| PUBLICITY.md fan-out section (this section) | 295 | 175 | 190 | 145 | 130 | 935 |

All six fan-out pieces are at or above the 900 ship line. Named
deductions: accuracy loses 2 to 10 per piece for summary
compression of the level READMEs (the full method, hand checks,
and per-route tables live in the level folders, not in the
fan-out pieces); research loses 10 to 30 per piece because the
fan-out reports measured repo work and names prior art from
DOSSIER.md and NOVELTY.md rather than adding new external
research, and the paper brief names no venue; gap fit loses 5 to
15 per piece because the synthetic small-model scope caps how
far any piece can speak to real model optimization roles;
clarity loses 2 to 10 per piece for the repeated scope lines
(synthetic model, QLAB not GGUF, NumPy pruning track), which are
mandatory honesty and cost reading flow; reach loses 5 to 30 per
piece because every social channel is held under the standing
gates, the paper is an unsubmitted brief, and no live website or
blog publication exists yet, so reach is draft reach, not
published reach.

## Actions polish pack (2026-11-05)

Applied through a pull request on 2026-11-05, following the Actions
polish pack standard. The pack adds: CI on a Python 3.11 and 3.12
matrix with a ruff lint step (the pre-existing CI step preserved:
scaffold smoke test; plus per-level test and runner steps for Learn,
Build, and Deep, following the proven pack pattern, with the repo
dependencies installed from requirements.txt), CodeQL scanning,
Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions, a release workflow that
attaches a source tarball named quantization-lab-<tag>.tar.gz to
v* tag releases, Labeler, Greetings (snake_case inputs for
actions/first-interaction@v3: repo_token, issue_message,
pr_message), Stale in comment-only mode (days-before-close: -1,
never closes), and a docs summary page at docs/index.md for GitHub
Pages. Ruff scope is recorded in ruff.toml (E, F, I, line-length
120). Ruff fixes in this pull request were style only: the first
ruff run found 5 errors (import formatting in
level-1-learn/run_learn.py, tests/test_learn_quantization.py, and
tests/test_smoke.py, and unused numpy imports in
level-3-deep/deep_system.py and tests/test_deep_system.py), fixed
by ruff fix output, with no change to behaviour, imported names in
use, or any string value. All three results files stayed unchanged
across the runners apart from the timing fields in the Build and
Deep results, which were restored. requirements.txt records the
true dependency fact for this repo: Level 1 uses the Python
standard library only, and Level 2, Level 3, and the Build and
Deep tests use NumPy, pinned to the measured version 1.26.4.

| Channel | Outcome on 2026-11-05 |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages | Docs page added at docs/index.md in this pull request. Pages enablement and live build status are verified after merge and recorded in the batch ledger; no live claim is made in this file before that check. |
| PyPI publishing | Held: needs a PyPI token, a new credential. Jesun's tap only. Not set up. |
| Social channels (LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads) | Held: no posts made. The loop never posts to social; Threads waits for Jesun's tap per post under the standing gates. |

Publicity grade for this polish pack log piece, on the 1,000
point rubric (accuracy 300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity
150, reach format 150), ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PUBLICITY.md polish pack section (2026-11-05) | 295 | 180 | 195 | 145 | 95 | 910 |

At or above the 900 ship line. Named deductions: research minus
20, because the pack is a standard applied across repos and this
section records its application rather than new research; reach
minus 55, because the docs page is copy in this pull request with
no live Pages claim yet, PyPI publishing is held, and no social
channel carries this piece by the standing gates; accuracy minus
5, gap fit minus 5, and clarity minus 5 for summary compression
of the full pack standard, which lives in the batch files.
